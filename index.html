         <span class="verse-number" > 2 </span>  and the Life [an aspect of His being] was manifested, and we have seen [it as eyewitnesses] and testify and declare to you [the Life], the eternal Life who was [already existing] with the Father and was [actually] made visible to us [His followers]—
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 3 </span>  what we have seen and heard we also proclaim to you, so that you too may have fellowship [as partners] with us. And indeed our fellowship [which is a distinguishing mark of born-again believers] is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 4 </span>  We are writing these things to you so that our joy [in seeing you included] may be made complete [by having you share in the joy of salvation]. 
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 5 </span>  This is the message [of God’s promised revelation] which we have heard from Him and now announce to you, that God is Light [He is holy, His message is truthful, He is perfect in righteousness], and in Him there is no darkness at all [no sin, no wickedness, no imperfection].

         <span class="verse-number" > 8 </span>  If we say we have no sin [refusing to admit that we are sinners], we delude ourselves and the truth is not in us. [His word does not live in our hearts.]

      <h3>CONCLUSION </h3> 
     <span class='fitSpan'>
     How we behave, treat others and live our life is as a result of the kind of Spirit that is dwelling in us. We should know that when GOD dwells in us, we are to walk and live with and in GOD the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. We can boldly come to GOD and ask for our daily bread as we are HIS Children. What parent will leave and ignore the cry of his obedient child? GOD can only dwell in a life that is free from sin and a man that allows and welcomes Him to stay. He will not barge in forcefully. Let us live our life with the consciousness that our body is the temple of GOD.
