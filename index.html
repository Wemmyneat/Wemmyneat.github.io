    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <span class='fitSpan'>   
      The plan of God always and especially in this end time is to raise men and women who will impact their world positively. People who will depend on Him fully and daily to be made great in-order to do exploits. God has not called us to serve Him in vain; He has called us for blessings. They are distinctive people with strength of Christian character, unbroken communion, courage and convictions that show that they have been chosen by the Master to do exploits. In this study, we will see the call and expectations of heaven upon our lives, while some end up as un-sung heroes and die with their talents because they were distracted when their services were needed most.

      <h3>CONCLUSION </h3> 
     <span class='fitSpan'>
     The call and mobilization of youths who will do exploits is on-going. However, the danger of moving with the crowd is equally looming. The study has highlighted the need to be involved in the walk with the Lord, in order to work for the Master. Don't end up as an unsung hero. Don't die with your talents. Simply answer the call today.
