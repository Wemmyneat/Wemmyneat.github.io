      <h3>CONCLUSION </h3> 
     <span class='fitSpan'>
     It is clear that with God's call on our lives, we have our own responsibility to ensure we tag along and stay in Him, so that our calling and election will be sure. The study has shown us that the exploit we are called to do is not in our own strength, as that will mean our doom. We must therefore keep depending on the grace of God.
