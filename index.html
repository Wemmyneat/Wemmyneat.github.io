         <span class="verse-number" > 11 </span>  And he said,  A certain man had two sons:  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 12 </span>  and the younger of them said to  his  father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth  to me  . And he divided unto them  his  living.  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 13 </span>  And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 14 </span>  And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 15 </span>  And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 16 </span>  And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 17 </span>  And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 18 </span>  I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 19 </span>  and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 20 </span>  And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 21 </span>  And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 22 </span>  But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put  it  on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on  his  feet:  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 23 </span>  and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill  it  ; and let us eat, and be merry:  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 24 </span>  for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 25 </span>  Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 26 </span>  And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 27 </span>  And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 28 </span>  And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 29 </span>  And he answering said to  his  father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 30 </span>  but as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 31 </span>  And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.  
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 32 </span>  It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.

         <p class="bible-text">
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 11 </span>  Jesus went on to say, “There was once a man who had two sons.
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 12 </span>  The younger one said to him, ‘Father, give me my share of the property now.’ So the man divided his property between his two sons.
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 13 </span>  After a few days the younger son sold his part of the property and left home with the money. He went to a country far away, where he wasted his money in reckless living.
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 14 </span>  He spent everything he had. Then a severe famine spread over that country, and he was left without a thing.
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 15 </span>  So he went to work for one of the citizens of that country, who sent him out to his farm to take care of the pigs.
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 16 </span>  He wished he could fill himself with the bean pods the pigs ate, but no one gave him anything to eat.
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 17 </span>  At last he came to his senses and said, ‘All my father's hired workers have more than they can eat, and here I am about to starve!
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 18 </span>  I will get up and go to my father and say, “Father, I have sinned against God and against you.
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 19 </span>  I am no longer fit to be called your son; treat me as one of your hired workers.”’
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 20 </span>  So he got up and started back to his father. “He was still a long way from home when his father saw him; his heart was filled with pity, and he ran, threw his arms around his son, and kissed him.
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 21 </span>  ‘Father,’ the son said, ‘I have sinned against God and against you. I am no longer fit to be called your son.’
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 22 </span>  But the father called to his servants. ‘Hurry!’ he said. ‘Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and shoes on his feet.
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 23 </span>  Then go and get the prize calf and kill it, and let us celebrate with a feast!
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 24 </span>  For this son of mine was dead, but now he is alive; he was lost, but now he has been found.’ And so the feasting began. 
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 25 </span>  “In the meantime the older son was out in the field. On his way back, when he came close to the house, he heard the music and dancing.
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 26 </span>  So he called one of the servants and asked him, ‘What's going on?’
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 27 </span>  ‘Your brother has come back home,’ the servant answered, ‘and your father has killed the prize calf, because he got him back safe and sound.’
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 28 </span>  The older brother was so angry that he would not go into the house; so his father came out and begged him to come in.
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 29 </span>  But he spoke back to his father, ‘Look, all these years I have worked for you like a slave, and I have never disobeyed your orders. What have you given me? Not even a goat for me to have a feast with my friends!
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 30 </span>  But this son of yours wasted all your property on prostitutes, and when he comes back home, you kill the prize calf for him!’
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 31 </span>  ‘My son,’ the father answered, ‘you are always here with me, and everything I have is yours.
               
         <span class="verse-number" > 32 </span>  But we had to celebrate and be happy, because your brother was dead, but now he is alive; he was lost, but now he has been found.’”

     <span class='fitSpan'>
